This is a BLE tool. I have put no effort into this readme.

the purpose of this is to display how to connect an esp32 or similar to a webpage or mobile app to allow near-distance remote control of elecronics.

the link in the top right will work on most computer browsers, but wont work on mobile unless specifically built for it.
the esp code is stored in the .cpp file.
